Notes on the mathematics covered in NUS EC2104 Quantitative Methods for Economic Analysis.

The author will only be taking EC2104 in the upcoming semester (AY2023/24 Semester 1). He has very limited knowledge in terms of what will or will not be covered in the course. A general outline of the content is retrieved from reviews on NUSMods as well as past-year midterm papers available online.

Some subsections in the document are dedicated to concepts specific to economics. However, the author does not major in Economics. The content in these subsections might therefore be inaccurate.

The notes currently only covers the calculus in EC2104. Besides calculus, the course also covers a good deal of linear algebra. This document will continue be updated in the future to include these contents.

The author is aware of, and does not care much about, the usage of sloppy mathematical notations, inaccurate definitions and incomplete theorems in the notes. Some degree of rigorousness has been sacrificed to make the notes more comprehensible by economics students.

If you have never taken calculus in secondary school (or have forgotten what you learnt), please note that the examples provided in this document are far from being sufficient in helping you to get familiar with questions that might come out in the examinations. I strongly advise you to find more exercises online to practice on. Moving forward, these lists of exercises might be added in the document.

If you encounter issues while digesting the notes and you somehow know the author, please approach the author for help. It might be a typo, or it might be something the author could not easily explain in a document like this.
